# pycarfac: A Cython wrapper for the ccarfac library

This is just a Cython wrapper for [ccarfac](https://github.com/analogouscircuit/ccarfac), 
a simple C implementation of Richard Lyon's CARFAC model of the auditory periphery. The python
wrapping makes the library suitable for use in, for example, machine learning data processing pipelines.  

There is a simple makefile, tested on x86 Linux (requires Cython and C compliation framework).

Example usage can be found in pycarfac_test.py.  Begin by importing the
library `pycarfac` generated by the makefile.  This will make available the function `carfac_nap`,
which takes the signal (a numpy array) as the
first argument and sampling rate as the second.  Additional (optional) parameters can be found in pycarfac.pyx.
This function will return a neural activity pattern (NAP) matrix as well as a set of center frequency (CF)
values for each auditory filter.

The function `carfac_sai` takes a NAP and generates a series of stabilized auditory images.  Usage of this function
is also demonstrated in pycarfac_test.py.

This is just "graduate student" code.  Feel free to use, but do so at your own risk.
